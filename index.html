            <p class="plainText"> My name is Luis Kevin Flores Ramirez. I was born in Mexico, May 1st of 1996.
                When I was young my mom owned this Cyber Cafe, where people of different ages would come in and work on
                their homework, finish their paperwork for their jobs or simply play games if they were kids.
                I would help my mom in her business by fixing the computers. What I would usually do was that every time
                a computer would break down I would fix it by opening the computer and cleaning the inside of it and
                connect it again. When the operating system will be slow and the clients wouldn’t be able to use the
                computers, I would delete the programs that didn’t work and that way I optimize them, if they were
                really bad, I would restore everything and they would work really well. Sometimes when one of the discs
                would burn out and the computer wouldn’t start I would noticed that depending on what the problem was I
                was able to fix it. For example, if the computer wouldn’t turn on at all it was the power. If it did
                turn on but it wouldn’t be able to get into the operating system it was because the hard disc was
                damaged and if it would get into the operating system but it would crash right away that meant that the
                memory was out. I would notice each problem and figure out their solution.
                When I was in Mexico, I was studying to become a Mechatronic Engineer. I took some classes in
                programming and that’s when I started to like Web Development. When I came to the United States I was
                thinking of what classes to take and what major to graduate, and I saw that the internet was the future
                and that nowadays everything is done online. So I decided to study Web Development.
                Since the day I fixed my first computer and the day I started to take programming classes my interest in
                Web Development became my dream. What I have done since that first computer that I fixed until now has
                been because I want to expand my knowledge in Web Development and someday become a Web Developer. I want
                to help companies to make their websites look better, but also to make them easier to navigate.
